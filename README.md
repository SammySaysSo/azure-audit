# azure-audit

The Azure Audit project automates many of the audits found in the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Azure Cloud Platform Foundation Benchmark. There is one script per benchmark. The script is named after the corresponding benchmark. The scripts can enumerate all resource groups in an organization and scan each, or the user can pass in the subscription and resource group as a parameter.
